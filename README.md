# Crisp

a language experiment for my own learning; maximize static reasoning ability

DISCLAIMER: USE AT OWN RISK

features
- purely functional (no mutations)
- pattern matching (including `___`)
- strong, static, inferred typing
- off-side language
- not ever intended to be finished
  - probably will never have IO or tons of essential things

## About the language

TODO: talk about all of these
- source: tabs, UTF-8
- each of the `value.Value` types
- REPL
- rough look at each of the expression types in the grammar

## About the internals

TODO: talk about all of these
- structure of the code at the package level and how the packages relate to each other
- plug Thorsten's books
